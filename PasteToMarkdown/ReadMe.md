How It Works
The user pastes content (e.g., HTML or rich text) into the input area.
As the user types or pastes, the content is automatically processed by Turndown.js, converting it into Markdown.
The Markdown output is displayed in the output area in real-time.
The user can click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the Markdown for use in other tools or platforms.
