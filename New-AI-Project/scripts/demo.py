🎯 What is Agentic AI?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Agentic AI represents autonomous intelligent agents that can:
• 🧠 Think and reason independently
• 🤝 Collaborate with other agents
• 🎯 Execute complex multi-step tasks
• 🔄 Learn and adapt from experience
• 🚀 Take initiative to solve problems

This project implements a Multi-Agent Research Assistant using:
